			<p>
				Undergraduate life at Rice University differs from that at many universities because of Rice's tradition of residential colleges. Before matriculating, each of the university's undergraduates becomes a member of one of 11 residential colleges, which have their own dining halls, public rooms, and dorms on campus; most of the first-year students and about 75 percent of all undergraduates reside at their associated colleges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because each student is randomly assigned to one of the colleges, and maintains membership in the same college throughout their undergraduate years, the colleges are enriched by the diversity of their students' backgrounds, academic interests and experiences, talents, and goals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A faculty magister, who is assigned to each college and lives in an adjacent house, helps cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as supporting an effective system of self-government. Other faculty or members of the community serve as associates to individual colleges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The experience of college residence is indispensable to conveying the rich flavor of academic life at Rice, allowing students to combine their usual studies with an array of social events, intramural sports, student plays, lecture series, innovative college-designed courses, and an active role in student government.

			<h3>Hanszen College</h3>
			<p>
				In 1957 William V. Houston, Rice's second President, initiated the college system, making Hanszen College one of the four original colleges. The college took the name Hanszen in honor of Harry Clay Hanszen, a member of the Rice University Board of Governors from 1946-1950, and whose wealth came from his ventures in the oil industry. Though long ago Hanszen was known as the "Gentlemen's College" and "The Uncollege," we are now known as the "Family College," a reflection of the close and caring relations among its members. Our current Commons, built in 2002, is a beautiful modern space where you will experience hours of games, fun, and bonding. HFH!!

			<h3>Jones College</h3>
			<p>
				Jones College was built as the first women's dormitory at Rice University. In the fall of 1980, Jones made a major change that would alter life at the college forever - it went co-ed! Since Jones became co-ed, Jones women have won the women's race a total of four times. Jones has a crazy amount of college spirit, and plenty of ways to get involved. JIBA!

		<div class="Brown" id="brown-college">
			<h3>Brown College</h3>
			<p>
				Margaret Root Brown College was established in 1965 and prides itself on its strong community and culture of care. Its members, past and present, rally around Brown's strong traditions while not being afraid to make innovations of their own. One of the things that makes Rice unique is its Residential College system and the opportunities for academic, social, and personal growth it provides. Within Brown, students will make some of the closest relationships they will have during their Rice careers and develop connections with our extensive network of Associates and Alumni. Brown is not only a building, it is a platform that provides every student with opportunities for innovation, leadership, and creativity.

		<div class="Lovett" id="lovett-college">
			<h3>Lovett College</h3>
			<p>
				Edgar Odell Lovett College is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president. Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of Jones College. Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges. Lovett sponsors numerous community and social events throughout the year, including theater productions and the Lovett Undergraduate Research Symposium. Lovett's college crest is based upon the Lovat family crest although the Lovat family is not related to Edgar Odell Lovett.

			<h3>Sid Richardson College</h3>
			<p>
				Sid Richardson College (also referred to as Sid, SRC, or Sid Rich) opened in 1971 as a men's residential college. Like the other residential colleges on the Rice campus, Sid Richardson College provides undergraduate residential and dining facilities, social organizations and student government, as well as faculty, alumni, and community associates. A $2 million pledge from the Sid Richardson Foundation, which was established by Texas oilman, cattleman, and philanthropist Sid W. Richardson (1891 - 1959), funded the construction of the college. The college became co-ed in 1987. Members of Sid Richardson College are called Sidizens.

			<h3>McMurtry College</h3>
			<p>
				McMurtry College is the 10th residential college to grace the Rice University campus. A LEED Gold certified building located on the northeastern edge of campus, it sits at the optimal location for those seeking the shortest path between their dorms and some of the most popular locations on campus, such as the academic quad (home to many buildings in which students will most likely have classes), Duncan Hall (for all things engineering), and the West Servery (the best place to eat at Rice).

			<h3>Duncan College</h3>
			<p>
				Duncan College, Rice University's eleventh residential college, is named to commemorate Charles William Duncan, Jr., who was U.S. Secretary of Energy on the Cabinet of President Jimmy Carter and former chairman of Rice Board of Governors, and his wife, Anne. The Duncans have a passion for environmental sustainability which was the motivation behind designing Duncan as Rice's "green" college. As such, Duncan is one of the first buildings in Houston to receive LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold Certification.
